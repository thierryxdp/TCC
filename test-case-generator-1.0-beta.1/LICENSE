GUIDELINES TO USE:
* Anyone can use this tool as long as the use is on a personal level without any corporate/Resell/Redistribution(after altering the code 
or changing its intended use) activity. The code is highly scalable and can potentially be used for software testing too(depending upon the 
software).
* If any use other than Personal use is required you may contact the developer for the same before proceeding and seek approval.
